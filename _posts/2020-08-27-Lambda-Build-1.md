This is my results from my first build at Lambda School, I chose to do my build on a Covid-19 Dataset with my question being, is the US doing as bad as every one is saying it is doing, and if so how bad is it. To start I had to figure out how to make the numbers comparable as number totals might look impressive, but don't mean much if two contries you are comparing have a widely diffrent population. So I wrote my code so that I can account for that and put my numbers as a percentage of the total population and then generated a couple of graphs, here are two that I think are really telling. Looking at it you can see that the U.S has have 1.2% of their total population has had covid, that is around 4 million people.

This line graph is used to show the curve of the epidemic, by showing how many active cases are there currently as you can see Italy has gotten over their curve, while others have flattend out, and the U.S is climbing rapidly.

I wouldn't say the data is eye opening, just a confirmation of what other sites and people are saying about the US covid situation. We are not doing good in the US. the most notable graph is the line graph that show how many current active cases we have, you can see the curve Italy went over this year and their situation was not great. It is a little scary thinking about how that number of active cases can easily quadruple into 16 million people in 2-3 weeks, then quadruple again into 64 million people, and so on. Covid may not be a serious concern for a lot of people, however I have asmtha, if I get sick, I can die, so it's a little hard to hear all these people talking about my life being incomparable to the economy, like I'm not worth anything. That was a little bit of a tangent, but the point is out of first world countries, the US is last in a lot of places regarding how the government is handiling the covid epidemic

Here is where I got the datasets to make these graphs
