This is my results from my first build at Lambda School, I chose to do my build on a Covid-19 Dataset, with my code a can generate many diffrent line and bar graphs of my choosing, first I looked at Confirmed cases as a percent of population, so this bar graphs represents that, looking at it you can see that the U.S has have 1.2% of their total population has had covid, that is around 4 million people.

This line graph is used to show the curve of the epidemic, by showing how many active cases are there currently as you can see Italy has gotten over their curve, while others have flattend out, and the U.S is climbing rapidly

The data really isn't that suprising, if you follow some sort of news you would know that the US is last place in public health in a lot of areas regarding Covid-19.
However the build was pretty difficult for my first one, the hardest challenge I had was how to make it so the charts could be comparable to eachother instead of just a total 
number of cases.

Here is where I got the datasets to make these graphs
